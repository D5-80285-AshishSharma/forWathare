The bar graph(stacked ) in GraphComplete folder takes data from mysql database (server.js exposes the endpoints) and displays using the react app(frontend folder).
In The new "Frontend" ,the canvas (html) container broke on  firefox,but worked fine on chrome(if you want your presentation layer to be in firefox,use a previous version of the component such as "HorizontalStackedBarChart copy 4" which is in the same folder)
